# MNIST Digit Classification – Perceptron vs ANN vs CNN

## Overview

**I built and compared three approaches for MNIST handwritten digit classification:**
- Perceptron (Single Layer)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN / Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  
The aim was to understand how performance improves as models become more sophisticated.

## Repository Structure

│── Dataset

│── CNN_Project.ipynb     # Jupyter Notebook with full implementation

│── README.md             # Project documentation

## Workflow

**1. Data Preprocessing**
- Loaded MNIST dataset (28×28 grayscale images).
- Normalized pixel values [0,1].
- Converted labels into categorical format.
  
**2. Visualization**
- Sample images plotted to better understand digit distribution.

**3.	Model Implementations**
- Perceptron: Simple linear classifier.
- ANN: Multi-layer perceptron with hidden layers & non-linear activations.
- CNN: Used convolution, pooling, dropout, and dense layers for feature extraction.

**4.	Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Results

**Model	Test Accuracy**

Perceptron = ~90.74%

ANN (MLP) = ~97.69%

CNN = ~99.21%

**CNN achieved the best performance, proving the strength of convolutional layers for image classification.**
